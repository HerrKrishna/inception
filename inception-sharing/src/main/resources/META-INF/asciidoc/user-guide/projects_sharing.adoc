= Invite Links

Project managers can generate invite links to their projects which allow users to easily join their project. For this, visit the *Project Settings* and click on *Share Project*. Clicking on *New Link* will generate the invite link that can then be copied and given to users (e.g. via email). These users need to already have a {product-name} account to be able to use the link.

The user can now follow the invite link by entering it into a browser. She might be prompted to log into {product-name} and is then automatically added to the project with annotator rights and directed to the project dashboard page. She can now start annotating.

NOTE: This feature is not enabled by default. However, you can enable it by adding `sharing.invites.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).
